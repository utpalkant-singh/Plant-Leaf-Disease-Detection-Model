ABSTRACT = {Potato leaf disease detection in an early stage is challenging because of variations in crop species, crop diseases symptoms and environmental factors. These factors make it difficult to detect potato leaf diseases in the early stage. Various machine learning techniques have been developed to detect potato leaf diseases. However, the existing methods cannot detect crop species and crop diseases in general because these models are trained and tested on images of plant leaves of a specific region. In this research, a multi-level deep learning model for potato leaf disease recognition has developed. At the first level, it extracts the potato leaves from the potato plant image using the YOLOv5 image segmentation technique. At the second level, a novel deep learning technique has been developed using a convolutional neural network to detect the early blight and late blight potato diseases from potato leaf images. The proposed potato leaf disease detection model was trained and tested on a potato leaf disease dataset. The potato leaf disease dataset contains 4062 images collected from the Central Punjab region of Pakistan. The proposed deep learning technique achieved 99.75% accuracy on the potato leaf disease dataset. The performance of the proposed techniques was also evaluated on the PlantVillage dataset. The proposed technique is also compared with the state-of-the-art models and achieved significantly concerning the accuracy and computational cost.},

abstract = {Potato blackleg is a tuber-borne bacterial disease caused by species within the genera Dickeya and Pectobacterium that can cause decay of plant tissue and wilting through the action of cell wall degrading enzymes released by the pathogen. In case of serious infections, tubers may rot before emergence. Management is largely based on the use of pathogen-free seed potato tubers. For this, fields are visually monitored both for certification and also to take out diseased plants to avoid spread to neighboring plants. Imaging potentially offers a quick and non-destructive way to inspect the health of potato plants in a field. Early detection of blackleg diseased plants with modern vision techniques can significantly reduce costs. In this paper, we studied the use of deep learning for detecting blackleg diseased potato plants. Two deep convolutional neural networks were trained on RGB images with healthy and diseased plants. One of these networks (ResNet18) was experimentally found to produce a precision of 95 % and recall of 91 % for the disease class. These results show that convolutional neural networks can be used to detect blackleg diseased potato plants.}
